# Motivation
This repository is my attempt to apply MrP for estimating support for next-to-be president H. W. Bush using polls data from 1988.

# Features

* Jupyter notebook for data prep-processing, model building and model fitting
* Streamlit app for exploring the post-stratification estimates in different demographic strata.

# References
There is not much innovation in this project as it was mostly aimed to help me learning how to apply MrP to survey data.  
  
**Data**  
The data comes from the [website](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) associated with Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill's book "Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models"

**Model**
The model is an adaptation of the extremely helpful [tutorial](https://austinrochford.com/posts/2017-07-09-mrpymc3.html) by Austin Rochford on how to use MrP for estimating support for gay marriage in the US.
